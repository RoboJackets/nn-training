# Neural Network Training

**Objective**: Learn how to implement state-of-the-art neural networks for object detection and other relevant tasks 

**Note**: *For all .ipynb files, open the notebook in Google Colaboratory instead of GitHubâ€™s viewer.*

**Lesson 1: The Fundamentals of Machine Learning**
+ Implement and play with the code from [an introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html) and [HackerEarth's practical tutorial on data manipulation with Numpy and Pandas in Python
](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/machine-learning/data-manipulation-visualisation-r-python/tutorial-data-manipulation-numpy-pandas-python/tutorial/)

**Lesson 2: Neural Networks in PyTorch**
+ Read and complete the exercises in [Lesson_Two.ipynb.](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_Two.ipynb) A [PDF version](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_Two.pdf) is also provided for convenience. 

**Lesson 3: Segmentation Models and Catalyst**
+ Study [Lesson_Three.ipynb](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_Three.ipynb). Once again, there is also [a PDF version](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_Three.pdf).

**Lesson 4: Further Studies (Optional)**
+ Explore the many detailed tutorials offered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/), [Catalyst,](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) or [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning)
+ Learn about and adhere to the [Pytorch Style Guide](https://github.com/IgorSusmelj/pytorch-styleguide)
+ Check out [Chris Albon's website](https://chrisalbon.com/)
+ Complete the [fast.ai courses](https://www.fast.ai/) or [Google's ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
