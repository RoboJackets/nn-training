# nn-training

Objective: Learn how to implement state-of-the-art neural networks for object detection. 

Open up the lessons in Google Colab; don't rely on Github's viewer. 

Lesson Overview: 
1. What is a neural network? How is one implemented using pure PyTorch in Google Colab? (in-progress)
2. How should data be explored, analyzed, and cleaned in machine learning? (not-started)
3. How should Catalyst be utilized? (not-started)

Resources: 
1. [Stanford's CNN Overview](https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#case) - article explaining how CNNs work
2. [Catalyst segmentation tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/catalyst-team/catalyst/blob/master/examples/notebooks/segmentation-tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=FRWGyaT2Y25j)
