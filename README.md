# Neural Network Training

**Objective**: Learn how to implement state-of-the-art neural networks for object detection and other relevant tasks 

**Note**: *For all .ipynb files, open the notebook in Google Colaboratory instead of GitHubâ€™s viewer.*

Lesson 1: Neural Networks in PyTorch
+ Read and complete the exercises in [Lesson_One.ipynb](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_One.ipynb)
+ Optionally, complete [Prof. Mark Riedl's PyTorch Primer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DgkVmi6GksWOByhYVQpyUB4Rk3PUq0Cp) or [the official PyTorch 60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

Lesson 2: Basic Machine Learning and Deep Learning 
+ TBD

Lesson 3: Segmentation Models in Catalyst 
+ TBD

Lesson 4: (Optional) Further Exploration 
+ Learn about and adhere to the [Pytorch Style Guide](https://github.com/IgorSusmelj/pytorch-styleguide)
