# Neural Network Training

**Objective**: Learn how to implement state-of-the-art neural networks for object detection and other relevant tasks 

**Note**: *For all .ipynb files, open the notebook in Google Colaboratory instead of GitHubâ€™s viewer.*

**Lesson 1: Basic Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
+ Implement and play with the code from [an introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html) and [HackerEarth's practical tutorial on data manipulation with Numpy and Pandas in Python
](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/machine-learning/data-manipulation-visualisation-r-python/tutorial-data-manipulation-numpy-pandas-python/tutorial/)

**Lesson 2: Neural Networks in PyTorch**
+ Read and complete the exercises in [Lesson_Two.ipynb](https://github.com/RoboJackets/nn-training/blob/master/Lesson_Two.ipynb)
+ ***Optional:*** Complete [Prof. Mark Riedl's PyTorch Primer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DgkVmi6GksWOByhYVQpyUB4Rk3PUq0Cp) or [the official PyTorch 60 minute blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

**Lesson 3: Segmentation Models and Catalyst**
+ Study [Jeremy Jordan's overview of semantic image segmentation](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/)
+ **Guided walkthrough of the IGVC semantic segmentation model coming soon**
+ ***Optional:*** Go through the [official Catalyst tutorials](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst)

**Lesson 4: Further Exploration *(Optional)***
+ Learn about and adhere to the [Pytorch Style Guide](https://github.com/IgorSusmelj/pytorch-styleguide)
+ Complete the [fast.ai courses](https://www.fast.ai/) or [Google's ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
+ Explore the many detailed [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) offered by PyTorch
